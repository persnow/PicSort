# PicSort

It's a tool that sorts pictures by date taken. It reads all pictures from a directory and moves them 
to another directory. The pictures are sorted in folders named like yyyy_MM where yyyy and MM 
are year and month of the picture creation date.

Currently only .jpg and .png images are supported.

PicSort is developed in C# with VisualStudio.
